# Introduction

### Linguistic Knowledge

- Linguistics is the scientific study of language.
- **Phonetic, Phonology, Morphology, Syntax, Semantics and Pragmatics** contribute to understanding a Language
- **Phonetics** deals with the production of speech sounds by humans, often without prior knowledge of the language being spoken.
- **Phonology** is about patterns of sounds, especially different patterns of sounds in different languages, or within each language, different patterns of sounds in different positions in words etc.
- **Morphology** deals with the understanding of how words are formed
- **Syntax** is focused on the way sentences are developed. How words are arranged to form sentences
- **Semantics** is concerned with meaning. The two main areas are:
    - logical semantics, concerned with matters such as sense and reference and presupposition and implication,
    - lexical semantics, concerned with the analysis of word meanings and relations between them.
- **Pragmatics** concerns about the meaning in context of discource

### **NLP subtopics**

- **NL understanding** involves conversion of human language, either input speech (acoustics/phonology) or user typed written words
- **NL generation** involves production of natural language from an internal computer representation to either written text or spoken sound. This process often decomposes into three operations: text planning (macroplanning of text content), sentence planning (microplanning of sentence-level organization), and sentence realization (grammatical rendering in linear sentential form).
- **Speech and acoustic** input begins with the understanding of acoustic sound (see Figure 5.18, left box). This includes phonology (the way sounds function within a given language) and morphology (the study of the structure of word forms) that address issues of word extraction from a spoken sound or dialogue.
- **Machine translation** involves translation of text from one language to another.
- **Text summarization** involves production of summaries of texts that incorporate the essential information in the text(s), given the readers’ interests.
- **Question answering** involves responding to user queries, ranging from simple fact (a single word or phrase) to complex answers (including histories, opinion, etc.).
- **Discourse analysis** involves conversion of human text within a discourse into an internal machine representation

### **Approaches in NLP**

Three main approaches in NLP:

1. **Rule based approach:**
    - Done manually, Rules must be defined
    - time consuming
    - more precise, but low recall
2. **Traditional ML**
    - Training corpus
    - Feature engineering
    - Define model eg probabilistic model
    - Training and inference
3. **Deep Learning approach**
    - Big training corpus
    - No feature generation
    - Define the model
    - Training and inference
