# What is Neural Network

 - Machine learning is, technically: searching for useful representations
of some input data, within a predefined space of possibilities (hypothesis space), using guidance from a feedback signal.

- Deep learning is a specific subfield of machine learning: a new take on learning representations from data that puts an emphasis on learning successive layers of increasingly meaningful representations. How many layers contribute to a model of the data is called the depth of the model.

- In deep learning, these layered representations are (almost always) learned via
models called *neural networks*, structured in literal layers stacked on top of each other.
