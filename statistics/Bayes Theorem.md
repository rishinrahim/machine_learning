# Bayes Theorem
- Bayes' Theorem is a simple mathematical formula used for calculating conditional probabilities. 
- It figures prominently in _subjectivist_ or _Bayesian_ approaches to epistemology, statistics, and inductive logic. 
- **Subjectivists**, who maintain that rational belief is governed by the laws of probability, lean heavily on conditional probabilities in their theories of evidence and their models of empirical learning. 
- Bayes' Theorem is central to these enterprises both because it simplifies the calculation of conditional probabilities and because it clarifies significant features of subjectivist position. Indeed, the Theorem's central insight — that a hypothesis is confirmed by any body of data that its truth renders probable — is the cornerstone of all subjectivist methodology.

> Evidence should not determine beliefs, but update them

The **formula of Bayes’ Theorem** involves the **posterior probability** $P(H | E)$ as the product of   $P(E | H)$ - the probability of event given the hypothesis is True, known as **Likelihood**, multiplied by $P(H)$  - the **Prior probability**, probability of the hypothesis  and divided by the probability of the evidence $P(E)$regardless of the hypothesis.:

$$P(H|E)= \frac{P(H)P(E | H)}{P(H)P(E|H)+P(\neg H)P(E |\neg H)} $$
				
> Rationality is not about procuring information but identifying which information is relevant

- Tests with high accuracy can give low predictive values
