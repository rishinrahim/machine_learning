# Basic concepts of Measurement

**Measurement is the process of assigning numbers to object to facilitate the use of mathematics**

#### Levels of Measurement
	- Nominal data
	- Ordinal Data
	- Interval Data
	- Ration Data
	- Continuous and discrete

#### Operationalization

• The process of specifying how a concept will be defined and measured.
• For eg Intelligence has no definite metric , instead we use IQ score to measure intelligence,
• Disaster preparedness, quality in life, pain etc. are other examples

**Proxy measurement**
The process of substituting one measurement with another

**Errors**
• Reducible errors /systemic errors
• Irreducible errors / random errors

**To evaluate methods of measurement, we use reliability and validity,**

**Reliability**

• How consistent or repeated measurements are.
• Many of the measures of reliability draws on correlation coefficient
• Three primary approaches: multiple occasion reliability, multiple forms reliability and internal
consistency.

• Multiple occasion : how similarly a test or scale performs over repeated administration. Also
referred as temporal stability - stability over time. A common technique for assessing is to
measure the correlation coefficient of the scores from each occasion of the testing - this is
called coefficient of stability
• Multiple form : how similarly different versions of testing perform in measuring the same entity,
coefficient of equality is used to assess this.
• Internal consistency : how well the items that make up an instrument reflect the same construct. Average inter item correlation, average item total correlation

**Validity**
• Refers to how well a test or scale measures what it is supposed to measure
• Degree to which a data adheres to business needs or constraints.
• Types : Content validity, Construct validity, concurrent validity, predictive validity

**Triangulation**
• The process of combining different information from different sources to arrive at a true or at
least most accurate value eg : Multi method matrix(MTMM)
