# Hypothesis Testing

- Fundamental to inferential statistics
- Technique to statistically verify whether our assumption about the population from which sample is drawn is true.

**Steps**

1. Develop a hypothesis that can be tested mathematically
2. State the null and alternative hypothesis
3. Decide on appropriate statistical test,  gather data and do the calculations
4. Make decisions based on the results

Rejecting the null hypothesis is sometimes called “finding significance” or “finding
significant results” because our statistical analysis must show not only that there
are, say, differences in the group means but that those differences are statistically
significant

The process of statistical testing involves choosing a probability level or p-value., that defines when sample results will be considered strong enough to support rejection of the null hypothesis

Inferential statistics is a powerful tool that allows us to make probabilistic statements
about data. However, because those statements are probabilistic rather than absolute,
the possibility of error is inherent in the process
