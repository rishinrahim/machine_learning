# Method of Least squares

- In 19th century, Legendre and Gauss published papers on the Method of least squares, which implemented the earliest form of what is now known as Linear regression.
- The method of least squares is the automobile of modern statistical analysis. It and its numerous variations carry the bulk of statistical analysis and are known and valued by all.
- There has been disputes over the discovery of this method. Adrien Marie Legendre published the method in 1805, and Carl Friedrich Gauss in 1809. but Gauss claimed that he had been using this method since 1795, and one of the most famous priority disputes was off and running.
- At the turn of the 18th Century, Given the massive economic rewards of better navigation, geodesy, the study of the measurement of earth, was all the rage. At that time, a key tool of geodesists was the use of  the movements of other planets and comets, relative to Earth, as a way to understand Earth’s shape and behaviors. This led to better mapping and improved knowledge of location. It was in this historical context that the mathematicians Gauss and Legendre independently discovered the method of least squares, Least squares is a way to use data to make quantitative predictions.Both Gauss and Legendre used the method of least squares to understand the orbits of comets, based on inexact measurements of the comets’ previous locations.

- Although they were the creators of regression’s main feature, neither Gauss or Legendre used the word “regression” to refer to their method. The term regression was first applied to statistics by Francis Galton.
- Galton is a major figure in the development of statistics & genetics. Unfortunately, his studies of inheritance led to him to invent the term eugenics and advocate for the breeding of a “better” society.Galton used the term regression to explain a phenomenon he observed in nature. In the 1870s Galton collected data on the height of the descendants of extremely tall and extremely short trees. He wanted to know how “co-related” trees were to their parents. Galton published his analysis of his data in the 1886 paper Regression Towards Mediocrity in Hereditary Stature.We now refer to this phenomenon that Galton discovered as regression to the mean.

- By 1901, the statistician Karl Pearson was using the “regression line” to refer to least squares estimate. 
- Regression analysis as we know it today is primarily the work of R.A. Fisher, one the most renowned statisticians of the 20th Century. Fisher combined the work of Gauss and Pearson to develop a fully realized theory of the properties of least squares estimation.

- Even with the development of increasingly sophisticated algorithms for prediction and inference, good old least squares regression is still perhaps the crown jewel of statistical analysis.
