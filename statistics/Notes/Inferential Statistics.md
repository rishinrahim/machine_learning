# Inferential Statistics

Statistical inference is the science of **making decisions** about a **population** based on information from a a **sample** drawn from the population.

We have to be clear about which type of statistics to use in any particular analysis.  Two rules : 

if the case represent entire population and no generalization is required - use **descriptive.** If the case do not represent an entire population and we wish to generalize, then **use inferential**
