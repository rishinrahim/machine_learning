# Probability Distribution




 
 
 ## Distributions

- The practice of statistical inference frequently relies on making assumptions about the way the data is distributed.
- Transform data and make it fit some distribution
- A Probability distribution is defined by a formula that specifies what **values** can be taken by **data points** within the **distribution** and how **common** each value will be. eg Normal Distribution(bell curve)
- PD are useful as their **properties** and **characteristics** are **known**. If the actual distribution of data is closer to the PD, then many calculations can be performed on the actual data using the **assumptions** drawn from the PD.
- Commonly classified as **continuous**, meaning data can take any value in a given range and **Discrete**, data can take only certain values


 ### Bernoulli Distribution
 
 - Distribution of a single binary variable $x \in {0,1}$ ex: Flipping of a coin
 - Governed by $\mu$ which represents the probability when x = 1
