# Statistics


This is a personal exercise to learn statistics one day at a time. Statistics is a very exhaustive field and it will take years to become an expert. 
As statistics is an integral part of Machine Learning and data science, it is imperative to have a good grasp of different statistical concepts.
For this, I am aiming to learn statistics bit by bit, one concept at a time. My first goal is to complete this 100 days challenge where I learn something everyday.
This includes a lot of unlearning as most of the concepts to be learned n initial days might be already covered in our high school math/ statistics course.
I wish to learn statistics intuitively with lots of practice and analysing real world problems.
